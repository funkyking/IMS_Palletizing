[frmcheck]
fix - The maximum count is retrieving from datagrid not database which will cause 
issue when user reopens application because the value is not the total value of the pallet
but the datagrid it loaded with, so if item was removed it will give issue.

[frmProduction]
fix - auto Insert Pallets to [WorkOrderStatus] if they are completed or total ordercount reached Max
update - allow more smooth operation loading [Work Order] by option to filter display completed [Work Order] 


Remeber to Change SHIPPING DATABASE [Word Order ID] to [Work Order ID]
-Allow user to input two pallets as long as its a different container
-New Container has to handle split container
